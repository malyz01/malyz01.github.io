            build a habit - setting a todo list everyday to finish and if
            possible to do more, understand - try to translate the problem at
            hand in the most simple way possible, plan - take considerations of
            all the possible problem angles you will face, divide - try to
            breakdown difficult problems into a much more solvable problems,
            make an attempt at solving it - try solving it, stuck - locate the
            source of the problem then try a different solution. Do some
            research, a person in the internet might already solve your problem.
            Refactor - make your code readable inorder to find problems a lot
            quicker, reflect - review all the things you have done and summarize
            the things the needs improving, practice - keep on practicing until
            it will become second nature to you.

          <div class="sBody">
            It is where lectures or learning materials are sent out for students
            to access anytime during their free time. This would create an
            opportunity for teachers to let their students ask them questions
            regarding those lectures. By doing so, it helps both the student and
            teacher in managing their time and effort to learn.

            It was quite challenging as I'm not a sharing kind of guy but I was
            also relieved that I shared some information about me.

            A little bit. I was self conscious and was careful on not saying
            anything offensive or braggy.
