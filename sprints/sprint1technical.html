          <div class="sTitle">
            In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in
            plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?

          <div class="sBody">
            <p>
              A useful tool to run commands without the use of a mouse. Commands
              such as making a folder or deleting one and navigating through
              your directories with just a few words.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of analogy, it is like a old school filing cabinet where
              you need a key to open (command) it and do crud operation stuff
              with all those files. While compared to a UI, it is basically
              having a full feature remote control where you still have to
              locate the command in order to execute what you want to happen.

            Everything starts with a master branch, when you try to make some
            changes it will be save in a local branch which is called feature.
            When you are done with your changes or ready to share it to the
            master branch you will need to open a pull request to be further
            assess and tested. If all is satisfied, it will then merge to the
            master branch.
