            Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You

            Html is a simple straight forward guy. He (HTML) doesnâ€™t care much
            on how he looks as long as he delivers the services he was asked
            for. Then he met CSS (SHE), She is more on appearance counts kind of
            girl. CSS saw Html potentials to attract more clients if she did a
            make over to him. She was very persistent in convincing him to do a
            make over. For a short while, Html refused and then eventually
            agreed. She worked really hard to make him look good. Finally, after
            CSS finished her job. The result is outstanding, more clients came
            in to see HTML and thus boosting his sales all thanks to CSS.
