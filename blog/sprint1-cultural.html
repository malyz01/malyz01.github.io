            Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
            Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the

              Before I make any decision, I always weigh in the benefits vs
              disadvantages of the result. It is unlikely for me to even
              consider unethical decisions with the most benefit. However, I
              will take into consideration some compromises that can have both
              benefits and also be an ethical solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had some experience in work when a lead asked my co-worker to
              finish his work before the day ends and he keeps on ignoring it.
              What I did was, I approached my co-worker and asked if he is
              having trouble with the task given to him. We then brainstorm
              ideas on how to finish the task as efficiently as we can. As a
              result, he finished his work earlier and made a new system to take
              on new task with ease. He uses this system everyday and he was
              also motivated to keep on improving his system.

              My culture is quite flexible. We adapt to any kind of stress and
              not worry to much about it. We add humor to relieve some stress as
              well as maintain a level of professionalism. It greatly affected
              how I empathize with other people.

            Every culture has it’s own strength, My culture has influenced me
            greatly on how I interact with people. Being friendly, honest, kind,
            helpful, and mostly being positive. These are some of the identities
            I value the most.

            <p><strong>My Strengths:</strong></p>
            <p>
              I tend to do every task as quickly as possible, I do some more
              research in the things I don't quite understand, I will attempt
              many times in solving problems on my own before I finally asked
              for help, I'm a quick learner, optimist and has a never give up
              attitude, and I take criticism in a positive way in order for me
              to grow.
            </p>
            <p><strong>My Limitations:</strong></p>
            <p>
              I’m not the vocal type of person, I may misinterpret the things
              that I’m thinking (My thoughts are a bit faster than what I’m
              saying) and I tend to stutter when I try explaining things.

            Never give up attitude has the biggest impact for my strength to
            help me with my learning journey. As well as being a quick learner
            and an optimist.

            Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to
            work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
            Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they
            were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try
            now, and why.

          <div class="sBody">
            Whenever there is tension within the group I'm working, I usually
            talk to them privately to hear each options and try to understand
            their side of the story. We then pull in ideas on how to relieve
            those tension and make some compromise in order to work
            productively. In doing so, I usually use humor to break the ice and
            allow them to speak comfortably.
