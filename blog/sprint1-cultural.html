            Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.

              Whenever an ethical decision needs to be made, I always weigh in
              the benefits vs the disadvantages of the result. Obviously, I
              won’t consider unethical solution with the highest benefit. I will
              take into consideration some compromises that can likely have both
              benefits and ethical solution.

              In work related situations, when a lead asked my co-worker to
              finish his work before the day ends and he keeps on ignoring it. I
              don’t tell our lead anything negative about my co-worker but
              instead I try to reach out to my co-worker and try to remind him
              with his work and brainstorm an idea to quickly as well as have
              fun finishing his task. That way I can increase morale as well as
              not stress our lead.

              Philippine culture is quite flexible. We can usually adopt to any
              kind of stress and not worry to much about it. We usually take
              humor into consideration to relieve some stress as well as
              maintain a level of professionalism. By doing so, I'm not picky in
              terms of working with others.

            <p><strong>My Strengths:</strong></p>
            <p>
              I tend to do every task as quickly as possible, I do some more
              research in the things I don't quite understand, I will attempt
              many times in solving problems on my own before I finally asked
              for help, I'm a quick learner, optimist and has a never give up
              attitude, and I take criticism in a positive way in order for me
              to grow.
            </p>
            <p><strong>My Limitations:</strong></p>
            <p>
              I’m not the vocal type of person, I may misinterpret the things
              that I’m thinking (My thoughts are way faster than what I’m
              saying) and I tend to stutter when I tried explaining things.

            Never giving up attitude has the biggest impact for my strength to

            Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to
            work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
            Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they
            were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try
            now, and why.
          </div>
          <div class="sBody">
            Whenever there is tension within the group I'm working, I usually
            talk to them privately to hear each options and try to understand
            their side of the story. I may need to ask them for some compromise
            in order to work productively. In doing so, I tend to use humor to
            break the ice and allow them to be speak comfortably.
