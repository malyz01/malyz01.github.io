            Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage
            your workload in this programme. This should include - an
            explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and
            safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
            representatives.
          </div>
          <div class="sBody">
            Before enrolling in EDA, I have setup a plan on my calendar for
            everyday activities. This way I can manage how much free time I have
            and efficiently be productive at the same time. With my free time, I
            can help out other learners If they need someone’s help.

            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
          </div>
          <div class="sBody">
            I may need help to confirm all the activities finished if I did it
            correctly or otherwise. Other than that, If I need help I would ask
            my facilitator when our session comes.

            A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
          </div>
          <div class="sBody">
            Just for my preference, I like the facilitators because they are fun
            and friendly but when it comes to delivering learning materials, I
            would suggest a more professional way. Otherwise, it can deliver a
            more mixed sense learning experience.

            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
            committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau
            commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these
            in.
          </div>
          <div class="sBody">
            As I have mentioned above. I had planned my schedules before getting
            in EDA. I planned on doing EDA school stuff during weekends (8
            hours), or night-time (for about 2 hours). I may need confirmation
            for school drop-offs for weekdays if need to be as I’m still working
            during weekdays.
