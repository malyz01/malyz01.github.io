          <div class="sBody">
            I had this coding problem where I can't make an image animate where
            it grows to a certain size but doesn't go over the container. I
            tried googling the answer and found different results. I tried most
            of them and I finally got it to work. After I solved the problem I
            felt so accomplished that it made me happy even though I spent some
            time searching for the answer. I learned that patience and
            perseverance pays off.

          <div class="sBody">
            A button wasn't working the way I intend it to function.
            Supposesobly when clicking the button it would make something appear
            from the left the side going to the right side. I stayed focus and
            go back to the first line of code and assess each one. I used
            console.log where it will print out some detail when you give some
            data to it. It didn't take long for me to fixed it since all the
            details has been printed out and by then I was able to fix it. I
            felt really good since I did not have to ask for anyone's help nor
            searched google for answers. I learned that having a process to
            check for mistake can save a lot of time in fixing or debugging bad
            codes.

            I use this code whenever I get stuck on a serious problem. Sometimes
            you need to just take a step back and explain to ducky in lay mans
            term. This way I can look at a problem in a different angle.
