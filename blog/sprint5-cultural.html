            <p>
              I realize that I need to build up a bit of self esteem and try to
              become comfortable in discusing a problem with others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another thing is, I need to work on my EQ as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, I will have to practice a lot to master my listening
              skills. This is very important as I might misinterpret important
              details.

              Anyone can study programming but it takes a lot of work and
              dedication to become a programmer. The journey can be tough and
              confusing but the feeling on creating a program from scratch is
              positively indescribable.

            To teach us proper ethics as well as how to work with other

            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
